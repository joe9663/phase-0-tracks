# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is basically coding time travel.  Various past versions of a particular program or file are saved when using version control and the user can revert back to those save points if needed.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a cloned repository that allows you to make changes and test them before modifying the base file.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commits are saved changes to a repository.  A good commit message explains what changes were made or what files were added.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when there are multiple changes to the same section of a file being merged.  Git is unable to determine which changes should be made and leaves the data unmerged.
