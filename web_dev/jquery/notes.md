# JQUERY
----
+ First step is to go to W3 schools and see what they have on jquery. That has been the best resoure through this entire program, so it seems like a good place to start.

+ Next is to figure out what kind of functionailty does it add to basic JavaScript.

+ Choose up to 5 of those functions and explore each further.

+ Allow for a break every 45 mins to break up the monotany.

+ Trying to learn the entirety of jquery in 2 hours is unlikely, so be sure to focus on the major functions of it to get a general idea of what is possible by using it.

## How things turned out

W3 Schools turned out to be just as good as I thought it would be. Following the examples on the site made it clear what kind of events that jquery allowed for. Being able to load the entire library with a simple script line in the html doc makes it very easy to code for.

I started out by writing each functon in the header of the html document, but quickly realized that making a separate JavaScript file was a better idea to house all the code. This helped me work on some html referencing skills that I had not used in a while.
