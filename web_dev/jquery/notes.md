# JQUERY
----
+ First step is to go to W3 schools and see what they have on jquery. That has been the best resoure through this entire program, so it seems like a good place to start.

+ Next is to figure out what kind of functionailty does it add to basic JavaScript.

+ Choose up to 5 of those functions and explore each further.

+ Allow for a break every 45 mins to break up the monotany.

+ Trying to learn the entirety of jquery in 2 hours is unlikely, so be sure to focus on the major functions of it to get a general idea of what is possible by using it.
