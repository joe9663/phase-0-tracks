## Linux Philosophies
1. Make each program do one thing well. Build new programs rather than adding new features to old ones.
2. Expect the output of one program to be the input of another. Don't insist on interactive input.
3. Design software to be tried early. Throw away clumsy parts and rebuild them.
4. Use tools to lighten a programming task.

## Virtual Private Servers
A virtual private server is a piece of software that has all the functionality of a physical server. It has its own operating system and are much easier to create and manage thanks to being entirely software based. However, performance on them can be slower than on their physical counterparts. Two benefits of using VPSs over physical servers is that they are cost effective for smaller websites and that they are easy to scale up or down based on the processing needs.
