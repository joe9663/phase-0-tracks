## Linux Philosophies
1. Make each program do one thing well. Build new programs rather than adding new features to old ones.
2. Expect the output of one program to be the input of another. Don't insist on interactive input.
3. Design software to be tried early. Throw away clumsy parts and rebuild them.
4. Use tools to lighten a programming task.
