<h1>Barbecue is king!</h1>
<p>This page is for me to declare my love of barbecue to the world!</p>
<strong>Carolina barbecue is the best!</strong>
<em>Its the vinegar that separates it from the other kinds of barbecue.</em>
<ul>
	<li>Pork is the meat of choice when making this kind of barbecue.</li>
	<li>East Carolina style, my personal favorite, uses oak to smoke the meat.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Pork is the superior meat.</li>
	<li>Sweet barbevues are not my thing.</li>
</ol>
